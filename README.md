### Hey there

Iâ€™m currently working on mostly [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs) related Projects like bots and libraries. Only some of my projects are public and here on GitHub, though.

Also, I'm trying to learn more about cloud environments (specifically [GCP](https://cloud.google.com)), but also web technologies and frameworks (e.g. [gRPC](https://grpc.io), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)).
